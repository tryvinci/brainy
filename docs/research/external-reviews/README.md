# External reviews — intake process

Standing process for architecture / SOTA reviews from external agents or humans.

## SOP

1. **Receive** the review (paste or attachment).
2. **Adjudicate** against the current codebase (spot-check critical claims; do not accept vibes alone).
3. **Archive** under `docs/research/external-reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.md` using [TEMPLATE.md](./TEMPLATE.md).
4. **Refresh handoff surfaces** so the next agent sees truth:
   - `docs/research/external-agent-assessment-pack.md`
   - `docs/research/codebase-graph.md` + `codebase-graph.json`
   - `docs/research/program-execution-status.md`
5. **Queue work** in the accepted priority order (do not default to fusion retune).
6. **Link** the archive from `docs/research/README.md`.

## Default priority after 2026-08-04 architecture verdict

> raw evidence → typed semantics → temporal truth → kill scan-heavy retrieval → plan evidence → executable vertical packs

**PR1–PR7 of that sequence are CLOSED** (2026-08-05 closeout). Do not re-queue them unless a new review reopens a finding.

## Default priority for the next external agent pass

> **Improve reader quality over evidence packets** (composition / optional bounded LLM reader on packet IDs) → finish LME-100 adjudication → Mem0 same-pin → pack authority/procedures/conflict packets → evidence-as-search-primary only if ledger shows retrieval/coverage misses

Baseline pins: LLM-over-search smoke 60% (`c223da3d`); product `/recall` deterministic reader 43.3% (`f722342a`, MH 50%).
## Rejected by default (unless new evidence)

- Hand-tuned fusion constants without real lexical ranks
- Expanding benchmark-shaped query-category dictionaries
- Graph DB before canonical entities + temporal reads + planner
- Treating `memory_current_state` as canonical truth
- Ungrounded rolling profiles
- Top-k inflation as architecture substitute
